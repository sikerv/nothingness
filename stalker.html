    <h4> Stalker </h4>
    <h3 style="font-size: 20px">
        Stalker consists of three main characters: The stalker, the writer, and the professor. 
        <br><br><br>
        A stalker is what Russia called people who snuck in and out of the Zone.
        <br><br><br>
        The Zone's origins in the film are unknown. All that is known is that in the center of the Zone is "The Room," which according to the myths, fulfills your greatest desires. But the Zone is also filled with traps, and only careful travelers, generally lead by a stalker, could survive.
        <br><br><br>
        The three escape their residences, avoiding the military's cars and gunshots in order to hop on a railroad track car, equipped only with some gasoline, nuts, string, and the professor's backpack. They discuss why they are on the journey to the room. 
        <br><br><br>
        The writer seeks inspiration, having run out of creativity.
        <br><br><br>
        The professor hopes to recieve a nobel prize by analyzing the zone.
        <br><br><br>
        The stalker just wants to lead people to the Zone. 
        <br><br><br>
        The three realize what has happened to a previous stalker, Porcupine. Porucupine led his brother to the Room, which lead to his unfortunate death. The Room then revealed his inner desire for money, instead of the return of his brother's life. Overcome by guilt and grief, Porcupine committed suicide.
        <br><br><br>
        The professor unveils his secret plan to destroy the room with a bomb he has brought, showing why he cared so much about the backpack in earlier scenes. The writer claims that we cannot know our true desires, and the professor abandons his plan to bomb the room.
        <br><br><br>
        The movie ends with the stalker's daughter showing that she has magical powers; life has not made her hard and inflexible yet. 
    </h3>
    <h4> A Modern Application </h4>
    <h3 style="font-size: 20px">
    "Space is political, in the real world. People fight over territory at every level: Neighbors bicker over the property line, while borders define the shape of every nation and pin their identity to the map. The Zone of Stalker takes place right on the line that divides here from there. It is overgrown the same way that the Demilitarized Zone is overgrown, that strip of land between North and South Korea that is like a geographic scar. It is abandoned the way that the area around Chernobyl is abandoned ...
    <br><br>
    <br>
    These visions underscore the urgency of Tarkovsky’s Zone. President Donald Trump has wrenched the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement, and in other ways has brought us that much closer to catastrophic climate change. We should look around us and see a Zone coming into being, the spread of those toxic, forbidden regions now guarded by nation-states.

    The clock ticks. Tarkovsky’s Zone of liminal danger threatens to inherit the earth. Art about landscape will never be what it used to be, because our frame has changed. What better time to acquaint ourselves with Tarkosvky’s vision, brighter and clearer than ever?"
    - Josephine Livingstone
    <br><br><br>
    Stalker is an old film - completely out of context to most things we think about in modern times, but the imagery it presents is still a powerful motivator for analysis.
    <br><br><br>
    What argument does the room present when the it is said that no one knows their true desires?
    <br><br><br>
    How does man deal with our pliable to hard transformation over the course of our lives? Is it true?
    <br><br><br>
    What does the representation of the zone from a nuclear apocalypse mean for the room?
    <br><br><br>
