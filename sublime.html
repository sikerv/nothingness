<h4> The Duellists </h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px">
    The Duellists, produced in 1977, is a British film directed by Ridley Scott. The Duellists depicts the growth and continuence of the duels of two men: Lieutenant Gabriel Feraud, a strong Bonapartist and duel obsessor, and and Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert; a rational and careful soldier.
    <br><br><br>
    The Duellists begins with d'Hubert being ordered to arrest Feraud – but finds him at the house of a local lady, and still insists on arresting him. Feraud takes personal offense at being informed of such while in the house of a lady, and challenges d'Hubert to a duel – which ends as a stalemate as a female companion of Feraud's interferes.
    <br><br><br>
    The war interferes – and the two do not meet until six months later for their next duel, in which d'Hubert is seriously wounded, and cannot continue fighting, leading to another inconclusive result. After, d'Hubert is promoted to captain, which saves him from more duels as men of different ranks are forbidden from dueling. 
    <br><br><br>
    Years later, d'Hubert is in Germany – still the rank of captain, when he hears word of Feraud also being in Germany. d'Hubert attempts to avoid him, as he knows that he will be promoted to major soon – but Feraud catches him and challenges him yet again to a duel. The duel ends with a bloody Feraud, unable to continue.
    <br><br><br>
    The two later find eachother amid a frozen front in Russia – during which before they can seize the opportunity to fight eachother, they are attacked by Russians, forcing them to fight together. The two do not see eachother again for a while.
    <br><br><br>
    After the wars, d'Hubert is living peacefully – a healing war veteran of the brigadier-general rank. d'Hubert refuses to join a potential return of Napoleon – to which Feraud claims he knew that d'Hubert was always a traitor. Napoleon is defeated, and Feraud is arrested for his part in the battle, which the fate of execution looming.
    <br><br><br>
    d'Hubert discoveres this, and insists on the pardoning of Feraud, insistent that he is not a threat, and hides his actions from Feraud. Feraud learns of d'Hubert's promotion, and finds and challenges him to a pistol duel. d'Hubert agrees, and after Feraud quickly fires his two shots, d'Hubert catches him and aims his gun at him. Instead of killing him, d'Hubert states that he owns his life according to tradition – and in all future interactions, Feraud shall conduct himself as a dead man.

    <h4> The Sublime </h4>
<h3 style="font-size: 22px;">
    "The Sublime is a feeling terrifying yet desired. In this respect it differs from a feeling of the Beautiful which lacks the aspect of terror. Examples of that which cause an experience of the Sublime could include a vision of the starry universe on a cloudless night, a grand view of the ocean, a powerful speech that conveys more than can be immediately settled by the mind, a piece of sober music that over-awes, a tract about the dark metaphysical, about the eternal, about that which overpowers."
</h3>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;">
    - Peter Sjöstedt-H
</h3>
<br><br><br>
<h3 style="font-size: 20px">   
    The final scene is an example of the sublime: Feraud has had his entire identity stripped from him. His life has revolved around this duel – and he gazes out into the abyss knowing what his destiny is.
