        "A certain feeling as it were of "self-renunciation," a certain feeling of indifference, a certain feeling of intimacy with danger, a feeling like a remarkable mixture of nothingness and vital power—all these feelings swarmed forth from his calling, bore down upon me, and took me captive, at the age of four."

    <h4> Confessions of a Mask </h4>

    <h3 style="font-size: 20px">
        Confessions of a Mask is perhaps Mishima's most famous work. The book is as titled, the confession of Yukio Mishima's of his homosexuality. Confessions of a Mask deals with the topic of sexual norms and discusses the self questioning culture that many closeted non-heterosexual feel can identify with. The story is told from the perspective of a man named Kochan, who is struggling with his own secret homosexuality. The story significantly explores the concepts of nihilism, which you can find more information about in the nihilism section of the website.

    <h4> Patriotism </h4>

    <h3 style="font-size: 20px">
        Patriotism is a short story written by Yukio Mishima; a tale of love and devotion and a tale of death. In Patriotism, Mishima details the story of a young couple deeply in love during a time of war. The man is sent off to war, and the absence of the man makes the woman truely understand how deep her love is for him. The man returns, haunted from war, and absolute that he cannot return when they call for him. As soon as the man returns, then woman knows what he intends: "She understood clearly that her husband had spoken of his death"(99). The following passages consist of an elegent tale of death and nothingness – a unity between the couple and their desire for eachother to the very end. The man describes his consciousness: <br><br><br><br>"Was it death he was now waiting for? Or a wild ecstacy of the senses? The two seemed to overlap, almost as if the object of this bodily desire was death itself. But, however that might be, it was certain that never before had the lieutenant tasted such total freedom."(103).<br><br><br><br>The overlap of his desire Earthly things and his simultaneous yearning for death tell a tale of nothingness: that which is there and not there at the same time.    </h3>

    <h4> The Fate of Yukio Mishima </h4>

    <h3 style="font-size: 20px">
        Mishima died after attempting a coup of the government in Japan. Mishima and his men took over the Tokyo headquarters of the Eastern Command of the Japan Self-Defence forces. Once successful, Mishima delivered a speech to the soldiers, attempting to inspire them to lead a revolution that would reinstore the former emperor of Japan, whom he dedicated much of his life to. Instead, the soldiers generated a negative response, jeering at Mishima, after which Mishima performed seppuku, and a soldier of his cut his head off, after failing three times.
